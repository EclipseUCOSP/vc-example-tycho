Tycho Plugin
============

This is an example Eclipse plugin, built to demonstrate the basic workflow for
creating an Eclipse plugin which deploys to a P2 repository. It is mainly used for testing and requires a local environment setup to work correctly.

Compiling
---------

    This project depends on the org.eclipse.cbi.versionchecker.plugin project being built and installed in your local maven repository. 
    For the org.eclipse.cbi.versionchecker.plugin to work correctly you must have a mySQL database installed and running. See that project's readme for more info.
